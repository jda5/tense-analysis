# Tense Analysis

The `tense_analysis.py` script contains the source code used to evaluate the ratio of past to present-tense verbs in a corpus created from academic mathematics papers uploaded to the ArXiv, as well as the Brown and LOB corpora.

This work was done by *** at *** [censored for to protect the anonymity of the author(s) as their paper is being reviewed].

In order to run this script, you will need to install Python (version 3.8) and NLTK (version 3.6). Details on how to install Python can be found here: https://www.python.org, and you can learn how to install NLTK here: https://www.nltk.org/install.html.

Once you have these installed you can run the script by placing it in a folder with the corpora. The file structure should look like this:

```
|-- tense_analysis.py
|-- corpus
   |-- file1.txt
   |-- file2.txt
   |-- file3.txt
   etc.
```
